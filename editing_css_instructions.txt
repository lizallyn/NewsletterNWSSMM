How to get the logo as part of the HTML template for the PCFG biannual newsletter
Clara Bird, May 2022


1. Open RStudio

2. Open the readthedown.css file in the biannual_report folder… navigate to line 846 and change the file path to the logo to the relevant file path on your computer

3. Install the rmdformats package if it hasn’t already been installed (install.packages(“rmdformats”))

4. In finder/file explorer navigate to where the package is saved…. On my computer this is the file path:
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.0/Resources/library/rmdformats/templates/readthedown

5. Within that folder go to templates/readthedown

6. Drag and drop the readthedown.css file in the biannual_report folder (that you recently edited) into this folder to replace the original file

You should be good to go!
